The dataset includes variables such as age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and lifestyle indicators such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, converting age into years, and removing outliers based on physiological plausibility.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations were conducted to uncover key insights and relationships between variables. A correlation matrix was used to assess feature interdependence and identify the most influential factors contributing to cardiovascular disease.
Multiple classification algorithms were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The performance of these models was compared using accuracy metrics, with Random Forests achieving the highest accuracy among the tested algorithms.
The final model can be used as a clinical decision-support tool to assist healthcare providers in identifying patients at risk of developing heart disease, thereby enabling timely interventions and personalized care.
